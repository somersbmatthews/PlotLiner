What is my project?
   It is a website that displays text on one side with occasional anchors that cause the consequent text to be different. Objects are made to store values of the user's experience in anchor choice selection. Progress is shown and win/lose condition decided by the user's object values.

Why? I wanted to make a way for users to make their own adventure.

Tech used: Jquery, DOM, javascript

Lessons learned: looping through arrays of text is more challenging than you think. Semantic errors can lead to odd errors that console reads out such as "cannot read property of undefined), which can for instance be the result of a period being used instead of a comma.
